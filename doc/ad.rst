Propagator-orientation is a new programming paradigm under development
by Alexey Radul and Gerald Jay Sussman at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, with the support of the Mind Machine Project of same.
Scheme-Propagators is the most advanced programming language built
from the ground up to support the propagator-oriented paradigm, and is
being codeveloped with the paradigm itself by Alexey Radul and Gerald
Jay Sussman.

The propagator-orientation paradigm offers

- easy and natural non-sequential programming
- freedom from unnecessary worries about flow of control
- modular non-hierarchical composition of peer systems
  without imposing extraneous command structures
- easy and natural concurrent and distributed programming
- support for and unification of existing programming paradigms:

  - functional
  - object-oriented
  - constraint programming
  - logic programming

For more discusion of the paradigm and its benefits, please peruse the
`Art of the Propagator`_ paper or the `Propagation Networks`_ PhD
thesis; but that is now enough advertising.  You are presumably here
because you are already impressed, and want to start trying it out,
rather than to be even more convinced.
