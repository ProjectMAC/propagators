CONTENT:

The doc/ directory
  contains documents about the whole system, and aspects of it.  The
  main attractions as of this writing are the Propagator Networks
  thesis and the Art of the Propagator paper.

The core/ directory
  implements Alexey's thesis, much sanitized and somewhat extended and
  updated.
  - core/example-networks.scm contains the example networks used in
    the thesis

The extensions/ directory
  adds (or attempts to add) various additional features and ideas.
  The rest of the software relies on the extensions in extensions/ as
  well as the core in core/.

The examples/ directory
  contains extended examples of uses of propagator networks.  This
  code is not in any sense part of the system, but is a series of
  clients.

The support/ directory
  contains supporting stuff that isn't about propagators at all; just
  useful helpers and langauge facilities.
  - eq-properties
  - generic operations
  - a profiler
  - miscellaneous utilities

The explorations/ directory
  is exploratory --- trying to understand the (propagation) universe
  by writing code.  It should be considered fully unsupported: it may
  not work, it may be out of date, it may contain good ideas whose
  time has not yet come, etc.

The testing/ directory
  is the unit testing framework this project uses.  As software,
  testing/ is a separate entity and not part of the propagator project
  at all; but it so happens that Alexey also maintains it.


Random facts about this software:

! means normative but false
? means descriptive, currently true, but may cease to be true

The invariants do not apply to testing/.

support/, core/ and extensions/ have their own run-tests scripts that
runs the unit tests for that directory.

There is a toplevel run-tests script that runs all
the unit tests.

The examples directory is an exception: its tests take a very long
time; but you can run them manually if you want to.

Unit tests are in test/ subdirectories of their respective
directories.
- test/ directories and foo-test.scm files do not export useful
  definitions

Every directory (including the test/ directories) contains a load.scm
file whose job is to collect all the goodies in that directory (first
invoking the load files of any directories that one depends upon).
? How much of an exception are the examples/ and explorations/
  directories to this?

? Some of the extensions rely on the symbolic algebra subsystems in
Scmutils.  You can get Scmutils from TODO.  The mechanics script tries
to find your Scmutils install, and exits politely if it cannot find
one.

test group mumble is in the test file mumble-test.scm
? there are a couple of tests here and there in the toplevel test group
test suites are runnable from the REPL

? support/, core/, extensions/, and examples/* are the entry points.
