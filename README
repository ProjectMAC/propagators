Random facts about this software:

The core/ directory implements Axch's thesis, much sanitized and
somewhat extended and updated.
- core/example-networks.scm contains the example networks used in the
  thesis

The extensions/ directory adds (or attempts to add) various additional
features and ideas.  The rest of the software relies on the extensions
in extensions/ as well as the core in core/.

Every directory has its own run-tests script that
runs the unit tests for that directory.

There is a toplevel run-tests script that runs all
the unit tests.

The examples directory is an exception: its tests take a very long
time; but you can run them manually if you want to.

Unit tests are in test/ subdirectories of their respective
directories.
- test/directories and foo-test.scm files do not export useful
  definitions

The testing/ directory is the unit testing framework this project
uses; it is a separate entity (that axch also happens to maintain).

The support/ directory contains supporting stuff that isn't really
about propagators at all, but just facilities I happen to like.
- eq-properties
- generic operations
- a profiler
- miscellaneous utilities

Every directory (including the test/ directories) contains a load.scm
file whose job is to collect all the goodies in that directory.
- How much of an exception is the examples/ directory to this?

The stuff in explorations/ is exploratory --- it may not work, it may
be out of date, etc.  Do not use it as an example of good style :)

The pubs/ directory is for publications.  There are currently no
finished publications there.

Some of the extensions rely on the symbolic algebra subsystems in
Scmutils.  You can get Scmutils from TODO.  The mechanics script tries
to find your Scmutils install, and exits politely if it cannot find
one.
