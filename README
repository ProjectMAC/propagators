Random facts about this software:

! means normative but false
? means descriptive, currently true, but may cease to be true

The core/ directory implements Axch's thesis, much sanitized and
somewhat extended and updated.
? core/example-networks.scm contains the example networks used in the
  thesis

The extensions/ directory adds (or attempts to add) various additional
features and ideas.  The rest of the software relies on the extensions
in extensions/ as well as the core in core/.

support/, core/ and extensions/ have their own run-tests scripts that
runs the unit tests for that directory.

There is a toplevel run-tests script that runs all
the unit tests.

The examples directory is an exception: its tests take a very long
time; but you can run them manually if you want to.

Unit tests are in test/ subdirectories of their respective
directories.
- test/ directories and foo-test.scm files do not export useful
  definitions

The testing/ directory is the unit testing framework this project
uses; it is a separate entity (that axch also happens to maintain).
- The other invariants do not apply to it.

The support/ directory contains supporting stuff that isn't really
about propagators at all, but just facilities I happen to like.
- eq-properties
- generic operations
- a profiler
- miscellaneous utilities

Every directory (including the test/ directories) contains a load.scm
file whose job is to collect all the goodies in that directory (first
invoking the load files of any directories that one depends upon).
? How much of an exception are the examples/ and explorations/
  directories to this?

The stuff in explorations/ is exploratory --- it may not work, it may
be out of date, etc.  Do not use it as an example of good style :)

? Some of the extensions rely on the symbolic algebra subsystems in
Scmutils.  You can get Scmutils from TODO.  The mechanics script tries
to find your Scmutils install, and exits politely if it cannot find
one.

test group mumble is in the test file mumble-test.scm
? there are a couple of tests here and there in the toplevel test group
test suites are runnable from the REPL

? support/, core/, extensions/, and examples/* are the entry points.
