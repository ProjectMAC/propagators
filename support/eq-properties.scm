;;;; Traditional LISP property lists
;;;   extended to work on any kind of 
;;;   eq? data structure.

;;; Property lists are a way of creating data that
;;; looks like a record structure without
;;; commiting to the fields that will be used
;;; until run time.  The use of such flexible
;;; structures is frowned upon by most computer
;;; scientists, because it is hard to statically
;;; determine the bounds of the behavior of a
;;; program written using this stuff.  But it
;;; makes it easy to write programs that confuse
;;; such computer scientists.  I personally find
;;; it difficult to write without such crutches.
