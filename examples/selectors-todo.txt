Pull the annoyance out of the computation, and make the critics deduce

Normalize use of expression style?  Including the pass-throughs?
- p:foo for the propagator version of foo
- e:foo for the expression-oriented propagator version of foo

Prettify the program for display.

Add more metadata for pictures.
- Better grouping of subfunctions

Draw pictures.

Debugger desideratum: a "logic analyzer" that would let me observe the
