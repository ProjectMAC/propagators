; this cross-thread nonsense is really obnoxious, as is having to eval everything
; and string it together. what can be done better?
; can lambdas check what thread they're running on and proxy to the correct one if
; incorrect? can all session operations proxy themselves in such a manner?
; (maybe this requires a threading model where the session threads behave
; like workers? or maybe the messages to run the lambdas and such can be queued
; to the ordinary blocking read alert target?) that kind of prevents parallel
; invocation, though.

55% cpu in master process, 10% in each of five worker processes
85% user cpu, 15% kernel cpu

So, why is run-time / real-time very close to master cpu / workers
cpu? coincidence? Or are they getting serialized for short RPCs? (I
wouldn't be surprised if they're serialized, but I don't quite see why
one thread should wait for the other's return even though each thread
does wait.)

The timing volatility does confuse me, though. Some compiles seem
worse than others, maybe as much as 20%? Or maybe it's machine state?
Master CPU usage goes up by a few percent, but clock time is even
worse.
Also, GC time seems to grow superlinearly in test run size...
