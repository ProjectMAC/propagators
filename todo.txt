Massage:
- Release and document test-manager carefully (esp interaction and produces)
- Write a "new propagator programmer" guide?

- Tease apart Scmutils stuff from Scheme stuff?
- Extract prop-dot into support/; abstract propagator stuff away from it?
- Add the appropriate elisp file for nice highlighting and indentation
- Concept diagram?  (All the way down to test-manager/, MIT Scheme,
  and Scheme?)  With concept dependencies, "how to know what
  concept(s) you are looking at", "how to know what concept(s) you
  need for task X".
- rake workbook (lots of enscript, with some file names and chapter names)
- rake stats (count files, lines, words, syntactic tokens, etc)
- Are there more example networks to be extracted out of the unit tests?
- Write decent progress reporting for all the examples?
  - solve-puzzle returns the answer and is suitable for a silent test
  - do-puzzle has wallpaper and is suitable for the repl
- Is voltage-divider* an example or an extension or a test of an extension?
  - Is electric-parts.scm an extension or an example?  bridge-rectifier?
- Draw all the example networks; and all the networks made by the examples/
- Can I get away with
  (in-test-group mumble (load "mumble-test"))
  being the standard way to do things?
  Can I abstract that?
  - Automatically localizes everything in the test files
- Read through all the code from the top

- Make emacs highlight rtd:mumble?
- fail-all, for-each-consistent-state, and map-consistent-states are
  only used by the bridge rectifier.  (Which might be an example
  anyway).  But they are in principle more general.  Where should they
  go?
- Where does the stuff in extensions/test-utils.scm belong?
- Look through the file structure of the tests again?
- Does defhandler want to become define-handler?
- Normalize the integrations being declared?
